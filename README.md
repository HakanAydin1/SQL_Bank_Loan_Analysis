# Introduction
Welcome to the Banking Analysis project! In this endeavor, I delve into the world of Banking Analysis, leveraging SQL queries and data visualization techniques to uncover insights into key performance indicators (KPIs), loan metrics, and market trends.

Through this project, I aim to explore various aspects of the banking sector, including loan applications, funded amounts, interest rates, debt-to-income ratios, and more. By analyzing these metrics, I seek to gain a deeper understanding of the financial landscape and identify opportunities for improvement and optimization.

This project not only serves as a platform to showcase my SQL skills but also provides valuable insights into the dynamics of the banking industry.

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the analysis, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Power BI:** Leveraged for data visualization, creating interactive dashboards to present insights visually and effectively.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.


# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific questions. Here‚Äôs how I approached each question:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(id) as Total_Loan_Applications FROM bank_loan_data


SELECT COUNT(id) as MTD_Total_Loan_Applications FROM bank_loan_data
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM issue_date) = 12 AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM issue_date) = 2021

SELECT COUNT(id) as PMTD_Total_Loan_Applications FROM bank_loan_data
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM issue_date) = 11 AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM issue_date) = 2021
```


### 2. Total Funded Amount

```sql
SELECT SUM(loan_ammount) AS Total_Funded_Amount FROM bank_loan_data

SELECT SUM(loan_ammount) AS MTD_Total_Funded_Amount FROM bank_loan_data
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM issue_date) = 12 AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM issue_date) = 2021

SELECT SUM(loan_ammount) AS PMTD_Total_Funded_Amount FROM bank_loan_data
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM issue_date) = 11 AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM issue_date) = 2021
```
### 3. Total Amount Received

```sql
SELECT SUM(total_payment) AS Total_Amount_Received FROM bank_loan_data

SELECT SUM(total_payment) AS MTD_Total_Amount_Received FROM bank_loan_data
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM issue_date) = 12 AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM issue_date) = 2021

SELECT SUM(total_payment) AS PMTD_Total_Amount_Received FROM bank_loan_data
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM issue_date) = 11 AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM issue_date) = 2021
```

### 4. Average Interest Rate

```sql
SELECT 
    skills,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
